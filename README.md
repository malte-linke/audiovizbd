# AudioVizBD

### This project is dead! If you really need a visualizer for Discord, check out my Powercord plugin <a href="https://github.com/malte-linke/powercord-pspectrum">PSpectrum</a>.

## Description

Adds an audio visualizer behind the user modal.
This plugin was originally made for Powercord but I ported it to BetterDiscord.
I also allowed myself to make some minor changes for better performance.

## Themes

You can customize the color of the visualiser by changing the background variable in your theme:

```css
.audioVisualizer {
  background-color: pink;
}
```

### Download

You can download the plugin [here](https://dev-parzival.github.io/audiovizbd/AudioVizBD.plugin.js).
